										One of my favorite aspects of graduate school is that your knowledge base grows exponentially. The first year of grad school is spent trying to figure out the basics: how do you make figures, collaborate with others, or iterate on a paper with your advisor. Three years later, things that previously seemed impossible click into place and you crank our papers. By the time you graduate, you are dragging your advisor and collaborators along in the wake of your excitement to blaze new paths of research.

										One of the most surprising aspects of my PhD was how closely each of my projects revolved around experiments. I entered graduate school as a theoretical physicist expecting to work on esoteric mathematical models, yet the direct connection with data provided a window into the exhilarating world of biology.

										While I have never physically manipulated these biological systems in the lab, my models allow me to push and prod and examine their behavior from the most mundane to the utterly extreme limits. The pace of biological research continues to grow at a staggering pace, and the field needs models that harness the incredible wealth of hard-won data to weave a few more threads of understanding into our tapestry of how these incredible living systems operate.

										The hardest part of grad school was working with experimentalists. But the best part of grad school was also working with experimentalists! When I did my first, truly joint theory-experiment project, I quickly realized that experiments...take...time. Whereas a theorist can promise to complete a section of a paper by a certain date (come hell or high water), doing careful and robust experimental work may require you to start over, again and again, for months!

										Every problem can be broken down into a number of steps, and every step is trivial for the right person. The key to a good collaboration is to choose the right set of poeple that cannot solve a problem individually, but that can crack it together. A theory/experiment provides a clean example, but collaborations between theorists or experimentalists often unlock beautiful new avenues of research. My own experiences attest that the result of good collaborations is a piece of work of far greater quality than what I could have accomplished on my own.

										Writ large, there are two overarching goals that pervade my dissertation. The first is to translate our biological knowledge into concrete physical models, enabling us to quantitatively describe how the key molecular components in each system interact to carry out their function. The second goal is to analyze how mutations can be mapped into the fundamental biophysical parameters governing each system.

										As you read through this work, I pose to you the following question that my advisor Rob Phillips asked during each project: "When should we be satisfied with our work and declare victory?" My answer has been that theory must push our understanding of a system until we uncover a jaw-dropping conclusion. While this criterion obviously depends upon the spring constant of your particular jaw, it emphasizes my view that it is not enough to simply draw a curve that fits the data. A successful model may give intuition into a previously unexplained phenomenon, provide a mental map with which to contemplate new experiments, enable you to search the spectrum of possible behaviors and completely characterize the system, or significantly accelerate the pace of experimental work. Each of my projects aim to fulfill at least one of these criteria. Collectively, I hope these works demonstrate how the melding of theory and experiment creates a whole that is far greater than the sum of its parts.

										Any experimentalist will tell you that there is variability in science, regardless of whether you are measuring the voltage
										across a circuit element or the protien production in a cell. Yet compared to physics, biology is a "squishy" science.
										By necessity, biology experiments can never be conducted at extremely low temperatures or on a single, simple component

										how their myriad parts weave together to generate a cell's complex beahvior.

										We explored this question in the context of trancriptional regulation, when DNA is read in order to produce protein. Many
										aspects of this fundamental process have been extensively studied, and the main players are shown on the left.
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										<em>Polymerase</em> (light blue) binds to DNA and initiates transcription, the first step in transforming this
										segment of DNA into a protein. When more polymerase is present, transcription will happen more often, leading to
										increased protein production.
										<!--If at a later time the cell wants to slow down this process, it can decrease the number 
										of polymerase molecules, although that will decrease not only gene expression at this site but globally for every gene. -->
										To slow down expression of this particular gene, a cell can produce a
										<em>repressor</em> (red) which can only bind to this specific gene. The repressor competes with the polymerase
										for the same binding spots on the DNA, so that when the repressor is bound polymerase will not read this DNA.
										<!--If at a 
										later time the cell wants to crank the production of this gene back up, it can either increase the number of 
										polymerase (which has a global effect) or decrease the number of repressors (which has a local effect).-->
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										But cells also respond to their environment, which introduces another level of regulation. A small molecule called an <em>inducer</em>										(small blue circle) can bind to the repressor and inactive it, so that the repressor is no longer capable of binding
										to the DNA. The benefit of having these multiple layers of regulation is that it enables cells to respond on different
										time scales - cells can quickly change the local concentration of an inducer in order to inactive repressors in
										minutes, but reducing the actual number of repressors can take hours. One of the best studied examples of an inducible
										system (and the one that we ran our experiments on) is the Lac repressor in <em>E. coli</em>: the gene contains
										enzymes to digest the sugar lactose, but this gene is normally silenced by a repressor except when lactose (the
										inducer) is present.

										While the interactions between these molecular players are qualitatively understood, there is no quantiative framework that
										can predict exactly how much gene expression will increase when the number of repressors are, say, doubled. Fueled
										by this challenge, we formulated a model for this system using a combination of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics.
										But we quickly ran into a problem - because this system was never quantitatively studied, many of the necessary
										parameters (such as how tightly the inducer binds to the repressor or the repressor binds to DNA) were unknown.

										To that end, we took data on a single strain of bacteria in order to characterize all of the parameters of the system. After
										that, we had the keys to the kingdom. We could predict exactly how the system should behave in any other setting.
										For example, it is experimentally striaghtforward to tune the number of repressors in a cell. So using our single
										data set (orange circles), we predicted how other strains should behave. And then came the real question: will
										our predictions accurately portray the behavior of our system?

										Amusingly, once we started to present these results to other professors, we began to get feedback such as, "Why don't the

										of 2" science where you are lucky to have a theory that matches your experiment to within a factor of 2. As the
										field develops, more exact theories will surely arise that minimize the small discrepancies between our theory
										and the data, yet it should be appreciated that before our paper there was only a qualitative understanding of

										The fantastic consistency between our theoretical predictions and experimental measurement does not spell out the end of
										the story. Rather, it provides justification that our theory is correct, so that we can now begin to explore transcriptional
										regulation theoretically (which is orders of magnitude faster than exploring it experimentally!). We can now make
										quantitative statements about the effects of the physical parameters governing the system (such as the binding
										strength between the repressor and inducer) and explore all of the possible phenotypes that a cell can exhibit.
										The data shown on the left is just the tip of the iceberg. This experiment has paved the way for a truly exciting
										possibility of quantitatively exploring the effects of mutations in the context of transcriptional regulation (see
										below).

										Mutations are one of the key tools biologists use to problem into living systems. By changing the amino acid composition
										of a protein and examining how well the resulting mutant functions, we can begin to understand how a protein functions.
										Most biology research deals with trying to understand and modify the behavior of existing proteins, and a few brave

										Another useful attribute of this theory is that it provides a framework to quantify the possible behaviors of different classes
										of mutants. In March 2017, five graduate students in the Phillips lab began exploring the quantitative reprocussions
										of this framework and determining whether this theory stands up to Bayesian model selection. This is ongoing research, but initial results look promising.

										able to cleave substrate extremely quickly) or an <em>inactive state</em> (where it speed is greatly diminished).
										The active state can often be hundreds of times faster than the inactive state.
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										Why these two allosteric states exist is an excellent biochemistry question. As a very rough explanation, proteins are very
										wobbly structures that often have access to numerous different configurations. Indeed, allostery is found in practically
										every biological context from ion channels to molecular motors to regulator proteins. In our simple model, we assume
										that an enzyme spends the vast majority of its time in only two of these states, so that we can neglect the other
										states.

										Now for the solution! Consider an allosteric enzyme which flip flops between an active (fast) state and an inactive (slow)
										state. Suppose this enzyme has two identical and independent binding sites for substrate. (Enzymes often have multiple
										binding sites, as it permits them to further increase their speed.)
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										Assume that, in the absence of substrate and competitive inhibitor, the enzyme prefers to be in the slower inactive state.
										If we now add substrate molecules, the enzyme will lethargically convert them into product.
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										Now let's add competitive inhibitor into the mix. Assume that when the inhibitor binds to the enzyme, it forces the enzyme
										to assume the much faster active state. So what happens when we vary the amount of competitive inhibitor?
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										The two extremes are the easiest to determine. In the absence of any competitive inhibitor, the enzyme will be chugging along
										at the laid-back speed of its inactive state. In the other limit, if we completely saturate the system with competitive
										inhibitor, the substrate will never bind to the enzyme and hence the enzyme's speed will go to zero, as no product
										is being made. But the middle regime is the interesting bit. If there is just enough competitive inhibitor that
										<em>only one</em> of the enzyme's sites is bound to competitive inhibitor, then the other site is free to bind
										substrate at the fast rate of the active state. If the speed of the enzyme in the active state is more than double
										its speed in the inactive state, then the fact that the inhibitor clogs up one of the two binding sites is made
										up for by the change in allosteric states. Mystery solved!

										Ion channels are signaling proteins that control the flow of ions into and out of the cell. These channels are the key players
										at the synapses of neurons, allowing electrical signals to quickly travel from your muscles to your brain.
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									Different classes of ion channels are triggered by different stimuli such as mechanical stress, a difference in voltage across
									the membrane, or the presence of a ligand. We will focus on the latter case, which is depicted on the right. Upon
									binding to a ligand, an ion channel opens up its central pore, permitting fast ionic flow (10<sup>6</sup>									- 10<sup>8</sup> ions/sec).

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									As seen in the above cases (in the induction of repressors and the kinetics of enzymes), ion channels are <em>allosteric</em>,
									which means the they assume two distinct conformations (an open and a closed state). This implies that the same
									tools and framework that we developed for the scenarios above should also apply in the context of ion channels.

										In 1995, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v376/n6540/abs/376514a0.html">Henry Lester's</a> group in
										Caltech discovered a curious quirk in one such ion channel. When they introduced a single mutation into one subunit
										of their ion channel, the ion channel became more sensitive, so that it took less ligand to make the channel open.
										When they applied this same mutation to a second subunit on the ion channel, they found that the channel became
										more sensitive again, and <em>by the same amount</em>! They mutated a third and then a fourth subunit and found
										each time that the response of the ion channel shifted by a constant amount.
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										Astonishing! At the time of publication, the group proposed that each mutation shifts the free energy of the system by a
										constant amount, and that the mutations are independent. Both ideas were extremely intriguing, but at the time
										there was no quantiative framework available to take these insights further.

										To make headway in understanding this data, we need a way not simply understand the individual responses of each ion channel
										mutant, but rather a way to understand the data from all five mutants simultaneously. The difference is subtle
										and often unappreciated, but this is exactly the reason why the analysis of these mutants did not proceed further
										in 1995.
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										Instead, we took theh approach of having a single model that describes the behavior of any ion channel. Our analysis began
										by understanding which physical parameters changed with each subsequent mutation, and we determined that it was
										the free energy difference between the open and closed ion channel states. We then confirmed the original hypothesis
										that this energy difference shifted by a constant amount with each mutation, and we showed how this translated
										to a constant shift in the response of the ion channels.
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										But how can we really show that we analyzed this system using a single, unified framework? How can we stress the point that
										we analyzed the data from all five mutants simultaneously, rather than separately? The answer is...

										The figure on the right shows a plot of the data as a function of the general free energy of the system, which we called
										the <em>Bohr parameter</em>. From this perspective, the five distinct responses of the ion channel mutants
										all collapse onto a single master curve.
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										This view nicely demonstrates the advantage of having one framework from which you can view all of your data. And you can
										also take the reverse approach: we can translate the generalized response back to find the spectrum of all possible
										phenotypes that the system can exhibit. In this way, we can begin to theoretically probe the space of all possible
										mutations, which can complement and guide experimental efforts.

										In many ways, I feel that this work highlights the future of biological research. Rather than trying to focusing on the individual
										responses of a protein, we can start to make general claims about families of mutants and about ion channels in
										general. One of the most exciting directions suggested by this work (and some of the work above) is that the effects
										of multiple mutations can be decoupled. The data on the right shows that mutating each subunit shifts the free
										energy difference of the system by a constant amount, independent of whether the other subunits are mutated. Fueled
										by these results, we are now doing a more systematic survey of mutations in the setting of allosteric transcription
										factors (see above).
