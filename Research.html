										A central goal of immunology research is to elicit a potent antibody response that can inhibit as many viruses as possible, ideally leaving a virus with no opportunities to mutate and escape. Experiments often measure how antibodies inhibit dozens of different viruses. 
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										Unfortunately, this constitutes a <i>tiny</I> fraction of all possible viruses - each year hundreds of new variants emerge and join the worldwide melee. When researchers seek antibodies that can comprehensively inhibit the whole gamut of viruses, they end up choosing a set of viruses with little-to-no overlap with the virus from other studies. This makes it difficult to combine the information between studies, and each dataset often ends up being analyzed in isolation and then forgotten.
									</p>
									
									<!-- Create some vertical space -->

										Indeed it is! When we combine datasets together, we can predict how the antibodies in one dataset would inhibit the viruses from <i>any other dataset</i>. With this mindset, the different virus panels in each study are not a weakness,  but rather an asset allowing us to explore the space of all possible viruses more fully.

										The implications are huge - each experiment takes significant time and resources, and by combining datasets we can massively expand the number of measurements in study by 10x or more.

										Of course, things are not that easy. Biology is riddled with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2014.02.021">anecdotes</a> highlighting that tiny differences in a protocol can lead to dramatically different results, so different datasets may have systematic differences that hamper combining them.

									<p>
										To overcome this difficulty, we develop a machine learning algorithm to quantify the transferability of information between two datasets. When two studies are very similar (i.e. if the blue viruses in the schematic behave the same in Dataset 1 and 2), then we can be confident that the relationship between the blue-and-green viruses can be transferred from Dataset 2→1 (and similarly for the blue-and-gray viruses from Dataset 1→2). In other words, we not only predict the behavior of new viruses, but also quantify our uncertainty for these predictions.

										The only caveat is that there must be at least 5 viruses that overlap between two studies in order to predict new virus behavior. Once that is achieved, both datasets can be expanded to predict values for all viruses in each study (without requiring a single additional measurement). Thus, modern studies can easily tap into the many large-scale studies carried out in the past decades, enabling them to leverage these past results to probe the antibody-virus landscape at far greater resolution.

										Of course, this is just the beginning. One of the perks of being a computational biologist is that you some of your projects are truly cross-disciplinary, and this framework certainly fits that mold. While it opens up many exciting avenues in influenza research, it can certainly be applied to other viruses, or more generally to other low-dimensional datasets.

										When we get infected by a virus, we generate a vast array of antibodies to clear the infection. While most of these antibodies are ultimately degraded, a subset stick around as memory cells in case we encounter this same virus in the future. Hence, each of us has a unique antibody repertoire based on our specific infection history.

										This question is surprisingly difficult to answer! Although our blood contains all of our antibodies, it is effectively a "black box." To separate out and characterize each antibody would require years of effort (by which point your antibody repertoire will have dramatically changed). In other words, our blood contains an unknown number of antibodies, and the protection offered by each of them against any virus strain is unknown.
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										Nevertheless, we can measure the <i>collective</i> protection from all the antibodies in your blood against different flu strains. But since each measurement requires some of your blood (an inherently limited commodity), we can only assess your protection against a few viruses, and from these measurements we must predict how you would fare against all other strains. But how can we possibly answer this question when we do not know the composition of your antibodies?

										My answer was to create a "map" of all possible antibody-virus interactions. The example data on the right quantify the protection of three antibodies against three viruses. These nine interactions are mapped onto the grid shown below, where antibodies that strongly protect against a virus will lie close to it on the map (within 2 grid units) whereas antibodies that offer weak protection lie further away (more than 4 grid units). See if you can convince yourself that the table of values matches the map results.
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										The power of this approach becomes apparent when we scale up the numbers. Each year, hundreds of different viruses are assessed against hundreds of different antibodies. Rather than looking at a spreadsheet containing ten thousand values, we can create a map that allows us to quantify and visualize the key players. But perhaps the most useful application of these maps is in the ability to decompose any antibody repertoire.

										Suppose that we have created a map of all the flu strains circulating this year (shown below on the right). To quantify your level of protection, we take a drop of your blood and measure its ability to inhibit a few of these viruses (e.g. the light-blue, light-green, and light-gray strains). Using just those three measurements (shown in the table), can you guess how protected you will be against the remaining viruses?
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										Take a moment to think this through. Remember that we do not know how many antibodies there are within your blood, but we can translate the information that we have into our map. Strong protection against a virus means that there must be an antibody nearby. So where would you predict your antibodies reside on the map? And given their positions, can you predict your level of protection against the rest of the viruses?

										At minimum there must be antibodies near the light-green and light-gray viruses, and with this information you can predict (a lower bound for) your protection against the other viruses. Granted, there may be more antibodies lurking in other regions of the map, but our ability to detect them grows with the number of measurements we have, and such antibodies would only increase your protection.
									</p>
									
									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										Our ability to say so much using only a few measurements is remarkable, given that we did not know how many antibodies there should be nor their individual protection profiles! So where did the information come from...? It came from the positions of the viruses on the map. An antibody can inhibit two viruses that lie close to one another, but not two viruses that are far apart. Thus, when your blood strongly inhibits two dissimilar viruses, we know that at least two antibodies must be at work.
									</p>
									
									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										This approach provides a new tool to peer into our immune repertoires and characterize our individual antibodies - something that I had considered impossible a year ago. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.28.270561">This work</a> has opened up an array of fascinating questions such as: How do our antibodies move along the map with each infection? Can an antibody be "guided" to a specific location? Given your specific antibodies, which vaccine strain would best augment your protection? Like any innovation, this one opens up many new and exciting roads that I cannot wait to travel!

										For my postdoc, I decided to shift lanes and apply my biophysics training to the realm of disease research. I joined the lab of <a href="https://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html">Jesse Bloom</a> to study how the influenza virus (a.k.a. flu) can evolve to escape from the antibodies that circulate within us.

										In preparation for my postdoc, I read Janeway's Immunobiology textbook which impressed upon me the exquisite complexity of our immune system, yet when I began my postdoc I still knew very little about flu biology. This meant that every week someone would blow my mind with a crazy fact about the global dynamics of flu, transmission bottlenecks, or vaccine effectiveness...in short, I was having a blast!

										To get myself oriented, I asked basic questions such as "How big is a flu virion?" and "How long does an infection typically last?" Regardless of the question, the most common response was, "It depends." I appreciated that answer - after all, humans are highly complex, and in my graduate studies I learned that even the behavior of individual bacteria can vary greatly, even though the population average was often tightly constrained. But when I pressed my colleagues for the typical range of values, no one seemed to know these numbers off the top of their head.
									</p>
									
									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										This response embodies a philosophical difference between biology and physics. Biology embraces the unique and breathtaking complexity of life, and the breadth of phenotypes is often of greatest interest. Physics promotes simple and unifying models, which can quantitatively describe key aspects of a system, but which might ignore some of its more nuanced behavior (think of the spherical cow analogy). Whether this tradeoff is worthwhile might be a matter of taste, but it explains why physicists yearn for key numbers in order to build quantitative models.

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										For example, notice that the influenza virion shown on the left is covered in teal and pink spikes. If you know the dimensions of the virus and the number of spikes, you could determine the nearest neighbor separation between adjacent spikes. Why is this an important number? It turns out that although antibodies often bind to the top of these spikes, the most sought-after antibodies bind to their stems (which are more conserved across flu strains). Given the average spacing between spikes, is there room for a stem-targeting antibody to bind to the stem of a spike?

										Let's follow these questions through. The 2D pictures on the left show that viruses have a variety of shapes. Most of the viruses used in experiments are spherical, although the long and narrow morphology is believed to help a virus infect humans more efficiently. For spherical viruses, the mean diameter is typically 125 nm (including the lengths of the spikes on either end).
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>
									
									<p>
										Given that there are 350 spikes spread uniformly on the surface of a virion, you can compute that the average separation will be 10 nm between nearest neighbor spikes. Since the width of an antibody is 15 nm, it will be a tight squeeze for it to bind to a spike's stem - it is possible, but the antibody will have to align itself just right. Indeed, squeezing into this tight slot reduces stem-antibody binding by about 10x.
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										This tight packing naturally leads to more questions. Is there enough room for every spike to be simultaneously bound by a stem-targeting antibody? If not, how are these antibodies able to stop a virus without binding to all spikes? Could it be that only a subset of spikes need to be bound in order to prevent the virus from infecting our cells? All of these questions are surprisingly understudied, and they are all motivated by some simple calculations that are only possible once we know some numbers.

										To answer these types of questions, I read broadly on many aspects of flu biology, gathering numbers from all contexts. How many virions are produced during an infection and how many of our cells do they destroy? How many antibodies do we produce when we get infected by flu? How can we quantify the protection offered by our antibodies? 
									</p>

										As I gathered these numbers, they naturally coalesced into different sectors of flu biology. As a fun mini-project, I put together a 1-page graphical illustration (published as a <a href="https://github.com/TalEinav/InfluenzaSnapshot">Cell SnapShot</a>) that highlights the key numbers underlying an influenza infection and our antibody response against the virus. This SnapShot is targeted at influenza researchers who are specialists in one aspect of flu biology but would like a 30,000-foot view of some of its other characteristics.

										One of the reasons I loved this project is that it melded my skill sets in science and illustration.

										One of my favorite aspects of graduate school is that your knowledge base grows exponentially. The first year of grad school is spent trying to figure out the basics: how do you make figures, collaborate with others, or iterate on a paper with your advisor. Three years later, things that previously seemed impossible click into place and you crank our papers. By the time you graduate, you are dragging your advisor and collaborators along in the wake of your excitement to blaze new paths of research.

										While I have never physically manipulated these biological systems in the lab, my models allow me to push and prod and examine their behavior from the most mundane to the utterly extreme limits.

										The hardest part of grad school was working with experimentalists. But the best part of grad school was also working with experimentalists! When I did my first, truly joint theory-experiment project, I quickly realized that experiments...take...time. Whereas a theorist can promise to complete a section of a paper by a certain date (come hell or high water), doing careful and robust experimental work may require you to start over, again and again, for months!

										Every problem can be broken down into a number of steps, and every step is trivial for the right person. The key to a good collaboration is to choose the right set of people that cannot solve a problem individually, but that can crack it together. A theory/experiment partnership provides a clean example, but collaborations between multiple theorists or multiple experimentalists often unlock beautiful new avenues of research. My own experiences attest that the result of good collaborations is a piece of work of far greater quality than what I could have accomplished on my own.

										Writ large, there are two overarching goals that pervade my dissertation. The first is to translate our biological knowledge into concrete physical models, enabling us to quantitatively describe how the key molecular components in each system interact to carry out their function. The second goal is to analyze how mutations can be mapped into the fundamental biophysical parameters governing each system.

										As you read through the projects on this page, I pose to you the following question that my advisor Rob Phillips asked throughout my PhD: "When is a model good enough? When should we declare victory?" My answer has been that theory must push our understanding of a system until we uncover a jaw-dropping conclusion. While this criterion obviously depends upon the spring constant of your particular jaw, it emphasizes that simply drawing a curve that fits the data is not enough. A successful model should give intuition into a previously unexplained phenomenon, provide a mental map with which to contemplate new experiments, and significantly accelerate the pace of research. Each of my projects aim to fulfill these criteria. Collectively, I hope these works demonstrate how the melding of theory and experiment creates a whole that is far greater than the sum of its parts.

										Halfway through my PhD, I painted a picture of my mom for her birthday, and I asked Jim Barry (the art teacher) if he would help me reveal it at the end of the term when my parents would visit campus. He happily agreed, and when my parents arrived he first gave us a grand tour of the Caltech Art Chateau, after which he showed my parents the 3D virtual reality drawing program on the Oculus Rift (where you can literally peer into a drawing). Then, right as they removed their headsets, Jim had me present my own work, beautifully framed and with the perfect lighting. My parents were astounded (and immediately asked Jim if he had secretly drew the piece!). To this day they vividly remember that trip because of Jim.

										During my second-to-last year at Caltech, I took a Storytelling class with my friend Heidi Klumpe (a biology graduate student and fellow dancer), and I was blown away by the elegance and creativity of her writing. Getting to glimpse such hidden talents is a privilege, and Heidi made what was already an excellent class an unforgettable experience. One year later, she asked if I would be willing to be interviewed for a new Caltech podcast series called <a href="https://caltechletters.org/podcasts/not-my-thesis/">Not My Thesis</a> that explores the lives of PhD students at Caltech. I happily agreed, and I was amazed by the passion and skill that Heidi invested into this project. Thanks to her efforts, you can listen to some of my favorite anecdotes from my time at Caltech and hear other accounts of what it is like to pursue a PhD.

										Any experimentalist will tell you that there is variability in science, regardless of whether you are measuring the voltage
										across a circuit element or the protein production in a cell. Yet compared to physics, biology is a "squishy" science.
										By necessity, biology experiments can never be conducted at extremely low temperatures or on a single, simple component

										how their myriad parts weave together to generate a cell's complex behavior.

										We explored this question in the context of transcriptional regulation, when DNA is read in order to produce protein. Many
										aspects of this fundamental process have been extensively studied, and the main players are shown on the left.

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										<em>Polymerase</em> (light blue) binds to DNA and initiates transcription, the first step in transforming this
										segment of DNA into a protein. When more polymerase is present, transcription will happen more often, leading to
										increased protein production.
										<!--If at a later time the cell wants to slow down this process, it can decrease the number 
										of polymerase molecules, although that will decrease not only gene expression at this site but globally for every gene. -->
										To slow down expression of this particular gene, a cell can produce a
										<em>repressor</em> (red) which can only bind to this specific gene. The repressor competes with the polymerase
										for the same binding spots on the DNA, so that when the repressor is bound polymerase will not read this DNA.
										<!--If at a 
										later time the cell wants to crank the production of this gene back up, it can either increase the number of 
										polymerase (which has a global effect) or decrease the number of repressors (which has a local effect).-->
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										But cells also respond to their environment, which introduces another level of regulation. A small molecule called an <em>inducer</em> (small blue circle) can bind to the repressor and inactive it, so that the repressor is no longer capable of binding
										to the DNA. The benefit of having these multiple layers of regulation is that it enables cells to respond on different
										time scales - cells can quickly change the local concentration of an inducer in order to inactive repressors in
										minutes, but reducing the actual number of repressors can take hours. One of the best studied examples of an inducible
										system (and the one that we ran our experiments on) is the Lac repressor in <em>E. coli</em>: the gene contains
										enzymes to digest the sugar lactose, but this gene is normally silenced by a repressor except when lactose (the
										inducer) is present.

										While the interactions between these molecular players are qualitatively understood, there is no quantitative framework that
										can predict exactly how much gene expression will increase when the number of repressors are, say, doubled. Fueled
										by this challenge, we formulated a model for this system using a combination of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics.
										But we quickly ran into a problem - because this system was never quantitatively studied, many of the necessary
										parameters (such as how tightly the inducer binds to the repressor or the repressor binds to DNA) were unknown.

										To that end, we took data on a single strain of bacteria in order to characterize all of the parameters of the system. After

										For example, it is experimentally straightforward to tune the number of repressors in a cell. So using our single

										our predictions accurately portray the behavior of our system?

										Before getting some answers, let's appreciate the context of these problems. The first phenomenon (dubbed "substrate inhibition")
										has been documented hundreds of times and is believed to occur in approximately 20% of all enzymes. This prevalence
										suggests that substrate inhibition may serve some critical function in enzyme behavior, and we also acknowledge
										that the known <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bies.200900167/abstract">mechanisms and advantages</a>										of for substrate inhibition will strongly depend on context of a particular enzyme.

										<em>Allostery</em> is the concept that an enzyme (or any other protein) can exist in two different conformational
										states. For our model, we will assume that an enzyme can exist in either an <em>active state</em> (where it is
										able to cleave substrate extremely quickly) or an <em>inactive state</em> (where it speed is greatly diminished).
										The active state can often be hundreds of times faster than the inactive state.
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										Why these two allosteric states exist is an excellent biochemistry question. As a very rough explanation, proteins are very
										wobbly structures that often have access to numerous different configurations. Indeed, allostery is found in practically
										every biological context from ion channels to molecular motors to regulator proteins. In our simple model, we assume
										that an enzyme spends the vast majority of its time in only two of these states, so that we can neglect the other
										states.

										Now for the solution! Consider an allosteric enzyme which flip flops between an active (fast) state and an inactive (slow)
										state. Suppose this enzyme has two identical and independent binding sites for substrate. (Enzymes often have multiple
										binding sites, as it permits them to further increase their speed.)
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										Assume that, in the absence of substrate and competitive inhibitor, the enzyme prefers to be in the slower inactive state.
										If we now add substrate molecules, the enzyme will lethargically convert them into product.
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										Now let's add competitive inhibitor into the mix. Assume that when the inhibitor binds to the enzyme, it forces the enzyme
										to assume the much faster active state. So what happens when we vary the amount of competitive inhibitor?
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										The two extremes are the easiest to determine. In the absence of any competitive inhibitor, the enzyme will be chugging along
										at the laid-back speed of its inactive state. In the other limit, if we completely saturate the system with competitive
										inhibitor, the substrate will never bind to the enzyme and hence the enzyme's speed will go to zero, as no product
										is being made. But the middle regime is the interesting bit. If there is just enough competitive inhibitor that
										<em>only one</em> of the enzyme's sites is bound to competitive inhibitor, then the other site is free to bind
										substrate at the fast rate of the active state. If the speed of the enzyme in the active state is more than double
										its speed in the inactive state, then the fact that the inhibitor clogs up one of the two binding sites is made
										up for by the change in allosteric states. Mystery solved!

										In working out the details of such system, the math not only provides you with precise conditions for when such peaks happen,
										but often times yield unexpected results. For example, the picture we painted above indicates that inhibitor acceleration
										only requires three assumptions: (1) an allosteric enzyme that (2) naturally favors the inactive state interacts
										with (3) a competitive inhibitor which favors the active state, then a peak should form. Yet when you carefully

										Ion channels are signaling proteins that control the flow of ions into and out of the cell. These channels are the key players
										at the synapses of neurons, allowing electrical signals to quickly travel from your muscles to your brain.
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									Different classes of ion channels are triggered by different stimuli such as mechanical stress, a difference in voltage across
									the membrane, or the presence of a ligand. We will focus on the latter case, which is depicted on the right. Upon
									binding to a ligand, an ion channel opens up its central pore, permitting fast ionic flow (10<sup>6</sup>									- 10<sup>8</sup> ions/sec).

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									As seen in the above cases (in the induction of repressors and the kinetics of enzymes), ion channels are <em>allosteric</em>,
									which means the they assume two distinct conformations (an open and a closed state). This implies that the same
									tools and framework that we developed for the scenarios above should also apply in the context of ion channels.

										In 1995, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v376/n6540/abs/376514a0.html">Henry Lester's</a> group in
										Caltech discovered a curious quirk in one such ion channel. When they introduced a single mutation into one subunit
										of their ion channel, the ion channel became more sensitive, so that it took less ligand to make the channel open.
										When they applied this same mutation to a second subunit on the ion channel, they found that the channel became
										more sensitive again, and <em>by the same amount</em>! They mutated a third and then a fourth subunit and found
										each time that the response of the ion channel shifted by a constant amount.

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->

										Astonishing! At the time of publication, the group proposed that each mutation shifts the free energy of the system by a

										To make headway in understanding this data, we need a way not simply understand the individual responses of each ion channel
										mutant, but rather a way to understand the data from all five mutants simultaneously. The difference is subtle
										and often unappreciated, but this is exactly the reason why the analysis of these mutants did not proceed further
										in 1995.
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->
									<div class="col-xs-0" style="height:10px;"></div>

									<p>
										Instead, we took the approach of having a single model that describes the behavior of any ion channel. Our analysis began
										by understanding which physical parameters changed with each subsequent mutation, and we determined that it was
										the free energy difference between the open and closed ion channel states. We then confirmed the original hypothesis
										that this energy difference shifted by a constant amount with each mutation, and we showed how this translated
										to a constant shift in the response of the ion channels.
									</p>

									<!-- Create some vertical space -->

										In many ways, I feel that this work highlights the future of biological research. Rather than trying to focusing on the individual
										responses of a protein, we can start to make general claims about families of mutants and about ion channels in
										general. One of the most exciting directions suggested by this work (and some of the work above) is that the effects
										of multiple mutations can be decoupled. The data on the right shows that mutating each subunit shifts the free
										energy difference of the system by a constant amount, independent of whether the other subunits are mutated. Fueled
										by these results, we are now doing a more systematic survey of mutations in the setting of allosteric transcription
										factors (see above).

										This simple model is worked out in my <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b01911">2016 paper</a>										with Linas Mazutis and Rob Phillips, where we also discuss the phenomenon of substrate inhibition. <a href="Other/Pictures/2015-12-13 Tal Einav ASCB Poster.pdf">A poster</a>										summarizing this work was presented at ASCB 2016.

										In working out the details of such system, the math not only provides you with precise conditions for when such peaks happen,
										but often times yield unexpected results. For example, the picture we painted above indicates that inhibitor acceleration
										only requires three assumptions: (1) an allosteric enzyme that (2) naturally favors the inactive state interacts
										with (3) a competitive inhibitor which favors the active state, then a peak should form. Yet when you carefully
										work through the theory, crossing the t's and dotting the i's, you find that one of these assumptions is actually
										not needed. You can find the juicy details in...<a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b01911">the paper</a>.
